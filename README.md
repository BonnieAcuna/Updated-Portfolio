# Updated-Portfolio

I updated the portfolio from before because I feel like my knowledge has improved than when I originally submitted my previous portfolio.  I changed every page so it looked a little more cleaned up and less cluttered.  I updated my contacts page and put links to my github and linkedIn as well as an updated resume. I put links to my projects that I have made and linked it to my github page and the deployed site.
